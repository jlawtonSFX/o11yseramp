# O11y SE Ramp Guide
The purpose of this plan is to assist you with establishing the key elements that are needed to become a successful SE at Splunk O11y.  This 5 week ramp up plan is designed to enable all new SEâ€™s to have the proper time to fully understand the Splunk O11y solution before being fully self-sufficient.
